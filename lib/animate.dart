// TODO: do a full pass on widget lifecycle support. Possibly params to reset on change?

/// The Flutter Animate library makes adding beautiful animated effects to your widgets
/// simple. It supports both a declarative and chained API. The latter is exposed
/// via the `Widget.animate` extension, which simply wraps the widget in `Animate`.
///
/// ```
/// // declarative:
/// Animate(child: foo, effects: [FadeEffect(), ScaleEffect()])
/// // equivalent chained API:
/// foo.animate().fade().scale() // equivalent to above
/// ```
///
/// Effects are always run in parallel (ie. the fade and scale effects in the
/// example above would be run simultaneously), but you can apply delays to
/// offset them or run them in sequence.
///
/// All effects classes are immutable, and can be shared between `Animate`
/// instances, which lets you create libraries of effects to reuse throughout
/// your app.
///
/// ```
/// List<Effect> transitionIn = [
///   FadeEffect(duration: 100.ms, curve: Curves.easeOut),
///   ScaleEffect(begin: 0.8, curve: Curves.easeIn)
/// ];
/// // then:
/// Animate(child: foo, effects: transitionIn)
/// // or:
/// foo.animate(effects: transitionIn)
/// ```
///
/// Effects inherit some of their properties (delay, duration, curve) from the
/// previous effect if unspecified. So in the examples above, the scale will use
/// the same duration as the fade that precedes it. All effects have
/// reasonable defaults, so they can be used simply: `foo.animate().fade()`
///
/// Note that all effects are composed together, not run sequentially. For example,
/// the following would not fade in myWidget, because the fadeOut effect would still be
/// applying an opacity of 0:
///
/// ```
/// myWidget.animate().fadeOut(duration: 200.ms).fadeIn(delay: 200.ms)
/// ```
///
/// See [SwapEffect] for one approach to work around this.
